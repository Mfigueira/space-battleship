# Space Battleship

(2018) Full Stack Development Bootcamp (MindHub LA) Final Project - Java, HTML, CSS and JS

## What is this?

This is an awesome game I made as my final project for the Mindhub LA bootcamp in 2018.

It's a custom Star Wars battleship game! Made for learning and having fun, with love.

## Can I see it? And play with it?

Yes! It's deployed and available [here](https://space-battleship.herokuapp.com/web/games.html).
